          1914 translation by H. Rackham "But I must explain to you how all this
          mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I
          will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual
          teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of
          human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself,
          because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to
          pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely
          painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to
          obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally
          circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great
          pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes
          laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it?
          But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a

          was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and
          expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the
          master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids
          pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not
          know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are
          extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or
          desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because
          occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure
          him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever
          undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some
          advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who
          chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one
          who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?" Section
          1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum", written by Cicero in 45 BC
